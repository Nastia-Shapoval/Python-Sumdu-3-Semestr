Question: Can you explain how list comprehensions work in Python?
Surname: Zarytska
Answer: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 
They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, 
and then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list 
resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and 
if clauses. For example, [x**2 for x in range(10)] generates a list of 
squares from 0 to 9.
